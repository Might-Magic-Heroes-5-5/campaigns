During combat, the units of your hero's army and the army of his adversary use Active Time Battle (ATB) mechanic and become active in turns, depending on their initiative value.
The Initiative Bar (also referred as ATB bar) in the bottom of the screen shows the order in which the units will be able to act.
The unit of creatures at the left of the bar is currently active and can be given an order: to stand in defense, to attack, or to manoeuvre on the battlefield.
To manoeuvre a unit, left-click on a highlighted square of the battlefield that is free and accessible to the creature.
