When fighting and travelling, your hero gains Experience Points and, ultimately, advances to the next level.This is the moment when you can select one of the proposed skills or abilities for him.

By selecting the circle button on top left of the level up pane you can explore the available skills for the hero class so you can plan your hero build.
