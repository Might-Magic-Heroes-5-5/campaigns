# Changes

## C1M2 - Haven: Rebellion
- fix: Vanilla tutorial is available and updated for 5.5
- fix: Impossible difficulty was treated as Normal

## C1M3 - Haven: The Siege
- fix: Tutorial is available and updated for 5.5
- fix(RC19c): Enemy hero appeared with 1 imp instead of similar army
- change: enemy hero army formula was based on Isabel army size OR a flat limit whichever is higher. This allowed for abuse abuse as the limit value was static and quite low. The limit formula is now based on the weeks passed since start.
- change: As soon as the enemy hero appears, he will try to capture the player town and will target player heroes if they are on his way.
- new: added Memory Mentor
- new: Added in a commented ambush battle vs necro units which was probably leftover by Nival developers. Winning grants a random minor artifact.
